/*
Welcome to the *｡･ﾟ★｡ magic ☆ﾟ･｡° event file!
You're probably here to add your new fabricated event to the event type!
Don't. I'm a big meanie and _will_ block your PR.

Instead, you'll want to set it up from your module file, using declaration merging
(https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html).
It'll look something like this:
```ts
declare module 'event' {
	interface EventTypeRepository {
		newEventType: FieldsInNewEventType
		otherNewEventType: FieldsButForTheOtherEventType
	}
}
```

Doing the above will automatically merge it into the `Event` type exported below,
making it available and discoverable throughout the rest of the parser.
