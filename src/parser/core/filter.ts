While I've tried to document it as best I can, the "code" below is some pretty
hefty typescript generic shenanigans that power and strongly-type the proxy
magic above. If you just want to use the filter as a consumer, I'd recommend
not reading any further.

That said, if you're interested in how it works, have a read! Let me know if
you've got any questions or anything, I spent quite a bit on time on this, and
I'd be more than happy to explain how it works!
