			Fix overcorrection caused by prior death-related changes that were leading to player deaths being ignored.
			Due to inaccuracies in data provided by FF Logs, this will cause deaths to be reported a few seconds after the actual time of death in-game.
			This will impact analysis, but should be relatively minimal overall.
