		<p>Welcome to the Bard module! Despite being a very straightforward job, Bard's complexity is deceiving.</p>
		<p>Considered by many as an <i>"easy to learn, hard to master"</i> job, Bard is a job that relies heavily on decision-making.</p>
		<p>Improvements on Bard can range from the fundamentals of properly utilizing songs (<ActionLink {...ACTIONS.THE_WANDERERS_MINUET}/>, <ActionLink {...ACTIONS.MAGES_BALLAD}/> and <ActionLink {...ACTIONS.ARMYS_PAEON}/>) up to the intricacies of <ActionLink {...ACTIONS.IRON_JAWS}/> and the concept of buff/debuff snapshotting.</p>
		<p>This analyzer will guide you through the job's core mechanics, all the way to encounter-specific optimization.</p>
