const description = `This analyzer aims to identify some of the low-hanging fruit that could be used to improve your WAR gameplay, as well as give a deeper insight into what happened during an encounter.
It's currently fairly feature complete, with minimal additions needed. If you need to learn how to WAR, you can always check out [The Balance](https://thebalanceffxiv.com/).
Any bugs, complaints, suggestions -- Join us on the XivA Discord, and ping me (Sayaka#6666) to let me know.`
