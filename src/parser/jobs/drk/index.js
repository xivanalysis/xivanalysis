			<p>This analyzer focuses on blood and mana usage, and then further explores common resource generation problems such as Blood Weapon usage and dropping GCDs.</p>
			<p>Most of the data in this evaluation tool is simulated, and edge cases from FFLogs can cause weird results.  If something doesn't look right, please report it in the discord.</p>
