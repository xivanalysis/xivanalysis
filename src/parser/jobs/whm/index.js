This analyser aims to identify some of the low-hanging fruit that could be used to improve your WHM gameplay, as well as give a deeper insight into what happened during an encounter.

If you would like to learn more about WHM, check the guides over at [The Balance](https://thebalanceffxiv.com/), and have a chat in the #whm_questions channel.

Currently this module can track DoT uptime, note when your healing lily gauge is full, detect clipping, detect interrupted casts, and report about missed oGCD casts.

Healing analysis can be very subjective - even if some of the below suggestions do not apply to you, they can help inform you about things you may have missed
