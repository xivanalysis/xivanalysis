This analyser aims to identify some of the low-hanging fruit that could be used to improve your WHM gameplay, as well as give a deeper insight into what happened during an encounter.

Note that since healing is a very fight-dependent process, it might be that some suggestions do not apply to you, but they may they help to inform you about things you have missed.

If you would like to learn more about WHM, check the guides over at [The Balance](https://thebalanceffxiv.com/), and have a chat in the #whm_questions channel.
