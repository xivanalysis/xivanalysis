# Goring Blade Uptime
* Will naturally be in the low 90s due to class nature. Should never be off for longer than 3 seconds outsidie of re-engagement. Most important flag.
* If two targets, ensure goring is on both targets. Only requires two ticks in order to be a DPS gain.
# Casting Clemency
* Interrupts combo, obvious flags.
# Proper utilization of FoF
* 10 total GCDs of FoF (Lead Goring, filler, end Goring) - see guide for a rotation image.
* At least 2 Gorings per FoF use - adds withstanding for extra uses.
* Ensure 1 Spirits Within, one Circle of Scorn per FoF use. (barring add delay).
* Naturally, they will be used every 63~ seconds, not 60. Requires a coding exceeption.
# Proper Req usage
* Ensure 5 casts of Holy Spirit in Req. Over 1 weave between casts will cause potential delays and loss of a hit.
* Maximum of 6 casts (extra granted by Refresh. Anything more than 6 in a row will cause issues with Goring Blade and Cooldown uptime.
* Extra check if casts were made outside of Requiescat, that would have caused a loss of mana.
* Check the rotation they use. If FoF > Req, ensure that Req was cast under the FoF buff. Potency loss if not.
# Overcapping defensive gauge - Sheltron on AoEs/raid wides for Shield Swipe 
* Will be hard to tell how many Shield Swipes a person should have per encounter. The gauge will naturally overcap in some encounters, like O7S off-tank. Average gauge gain is 120/min.
