# Goring Blade Uptime
* Will naturally be in the low 90s due to class nature. Should never be off for longer than 3 seconds outsidie of re-engagement. Most important flag.
* ~~If two targets, ensure goring is on both targets. Only requires two ticks in order to be a DPS gain.~~ No longer true in 5.0, Atonement is big damage.
* There are *weird scenarios* where letting Goring drop is ideal, but these can probably be overlooked.
# Casting Clemency
* Interrupts combo, obvious flags.
# Proper utilization of FoF
* 11 total GCDs of FoF (Lead Goring, filler, end Goring) - see guide for a rotation image.
* At most 2 Gorings per FoF use.
* Ensure 1 Spirits Within, 1 Circle of Scorn, 1+ Intervene per FoF use. (barring add delay). Sometimes worth to not use an Intervene, but that's fight specific.
* Naturally, they will be used every 63~ seconds, not 60. Requires a coding exceeption. With the intro of Atonement, possible to easily use every 60 seconds.
# Proper Req usage
* Ensure 3-4 casts of Holy Spirit and 1 Confiteor in Req.
* Extra check if casts were made outside of Requiescat, that would have caused a loss of mana.
