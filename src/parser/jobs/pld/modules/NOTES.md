# Goring Blade and Blade of Valor Uptime
* The combined Goring Blade and Blade of Valor uptime should be close to 100%. The only time one of them should not be up is durring re-engagement. Most important flag.
# Casting Clemency
* ~~Interrupts combo, obvious flags.~~ This is no longer true as of 6.1.
# Proper utilization of FoF
* 11 total GCDs of FoF (Lead Goring, filler, end Goring) - see guide for a rotation image.
* At most 2 Gorings per FoF use.
* Ensure 1 Spirits Within, 1 Circle of Scorn, 1+ Intervene per FoF use. (barring add delay). Sometimes worth to not use an Intervene, but that's fight specific.
* Naturally, they will be used every 63~ seconds, not 60. Requires a coding exceeption. With the intro of Atonement, possible to easily use every 60 seconds.
# Proper Req usage
* Ensure 4 casts of Holy Spirit and 1 Confiteor in Req.
* Extra check if casts were made outside of Requiescat, that would have caused a loss of mana.
