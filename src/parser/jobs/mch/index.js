				<Trans id="mch.about.description.warning"><strong>The module is a work in progress.</strong> It currently covers very few aspects of MCH gameplay, and while the existing features below should be reasonably accurate, this system <em>is</em> still in development, and may get a little mixed up sometimes. If you notice any issues or have any concerns/feature requests, please drop by our Discord channel or report a bug on our github repository!</Trans>
