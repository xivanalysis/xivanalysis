This analyser aims to identify some of the low-hanging fruit that could be used to improve your SMN gameplay, as well as give a deeper insight into what happened during an encounter.

Due to the nature of how SMN plays, there may be a near _overwhelming_ number of suggestions showing up below. Don't fret it, just focus on one or two improvements at a time.

If you would like to learn more about SMN, check the guides over at [Akhmorning](http://www.akhmorning.com/guide/intro/), the resources at [The Balance](https://thebalanceffxiv.com/), and have a chat in the #smn channels.
