## how2monk good and punch other things good too

### Uptime
- [ ] Don't clip or drop Demolish by more than 2 seconds, unless reapplying would be on GL0
- [ ] Avoid GL0 Demolish applications, if opener or downtime ignore this
- [ ] GL3 uptime
- [ ] General auto-attack uptime

### AoE
- [ ] Make sure there's enough enemies for RB or AotD effectiveness
- [ ] Allow AotD for Silence if we can tell if the enemy is actually interrupted

### Tornado Kick
- [ ] Minor on 8th RoF GCD instead of 9th
- [ ] Major if just after RoF drops
- [ ] Check recovery doesn't take more than 4 GCDs (PB is 3, ending before Snap and using RoW is 4)
- [ ] Use before forced downtime longer than RoE can be used, this might be fight specific and is hard to track since FFLogs is weird about GL refreshes

### Positionals
- [ ] Can kinda guess this from the damage mainly because MNK potency is high but it's a bit giri-giri
- [ ] Crit the Boot

### Buff Windows
- [ ] RoF basically on CD, take downtime into account or fights that derp a window
- [ ] Brotherhood, same as RoF besides slight variance for duration

### Forms
- [x] Reset forms by using Opo-Opo form skills in a different form
- [x] Form expiry (taking over 10s to transition)
- [x] Form Shifting under PB (WHY IS THIS A THING?)
- [x] Using formless DK or AotD
- [x] Form Shifting mid-combo

### Chakras
How do we track this? There's a game packet for meditative brotherhood procs but FFLogs doesn't use it
Maybe check for FBC being used at low GL when the next GCD gives a stack
