## how2monk good and punch other things good too

### Uptime
- [?] Don't clip or drop Demolish by more than 2 seconds, unless reapplying would be on GL0
- [ ] Avoid GL0 Demolish applications, if opener or downtime ignore this
- [ ] GL3-4 uptime
- [ ] GL3-4 efficient recovery
- [ ] GL holding with RoE/Anatman/6SSS (this prob needs to separate Gauge from GreasedLightning)
- [ ] Advise when downtime was short enough and damage taken for RoE, Anatman, or 6SSS
- [x] Wasted RoE (no trigger Earth's Reply)
- [x] Fists, make sure at least one is up
- [x] Dragon Kick buff checking Boot
- [?] Twin Snakes uptime and clipping (adjust for the double True shenanigans)

### AoE
- [x] Make sure there's enough enemies for AotD, FPF, RB, and Enlightenment effectiveness

### Tornado Kick
- [ ] Major if just after RoF drops, if its used at all
- [ ] Check recovery doesn't take more than 4 GCDs (PB is 3, ending before Snap and using RoW is 4)? wtf

### Positionals
ACT doesn't track this, the best we can do is simulate from damage but it's pretty ehhhh. For Boot we can check if it crits but it'd be pretty inaccurate.
- [x] Crit the Boot

### Buff Windows
- [x] RoF basically on CD, take downtime into account or fights that derp a window
- [x] Brotherhood, same as RoF besides slight variance for duration
- [x] RoF should last 10 GCDs depending on GLs
- [ ] Warn on GL3 vs GL4?
- [x] 2x Shoulder Tackle (in window, vs ongoing on CD)
- [x] RoF and BH overlap drift
- [x] EF/ST drift, they should ideally be weaved in the same GCD, or no more than 1 GCD apart
- [ ] Using 5-6 GCDs in PB depending on GL stacks (6 in GL4, otherwise 5)
- [ ] RoF regular window vs PB DK/Boot spam
- [ ] Form Shift and 6SS in PB is no bueno

### Forms
- [x] Reset forms by using Opo-Opo form skills in a different form
- [x] Form expiry (taking over 10s to transition)
- [x] Form Shifting under PB (WHY IS THIS A THING?)
- [x] Using formless Opo-Opo skills
- [x] Form Shifting mid-combo
- [x] Unbuffed Bootshine

### Chakras
How do we track this? There's a game packet for meditative brotherhood procs but FFLogs doesn't use it
Maybe check for FBC being used at low GL when the next GCD gives a stack
