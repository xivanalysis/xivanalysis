			<p>Hello friendly monk! Do you not Crit the Boot? Does your Six-Sided Star dream remain a meme?</p>
			<p>This monk analyser aims to help you realise your true potential as a monk by highlighting issues that can
				be difficult to spot in a raw log. The main focus is on your buff windows,
				gauge and buff uptime, and ensuring your cooldowns are used.</p>
			<p>If you notice anything that looks particularly wrong, please visit our Discord server and report it in the #support channel.</p>
