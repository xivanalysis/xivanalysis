So Square Enix just released a patch for XIV, and now you're trying to update XIVA for it? This document provides a list of some things to do, or keep an eye out for, in the process.

Some patches will require more work and changes than others - to facilitate, the notes below have been broken up into a few overarching categories, based on the approximate magnitude of a patch they apply to. Despite this, it's recommended that you read through all of it - just in case. Who knows what curve balls they might've thrown our way.

## `X.X_` Minor patches

## `X._0` Major patches

## `_.00` Expansions
